# Resetting the Database

If you need to clear the AssurancePlatform database and start with a fresh instance, it could be for one of these reasons:

- Cleaning up after a workshop or demo by removing all user data and created cases.
- Addressing non-migratable schema changes in the code.

The procedure for resetting the database varies based on where it's deployed â€“ either on your local machine or on Azure.

## For Local Deployments

1. **Identify the Database File**: By default, the database is an sqlite file located at `eap_backend/db.sqlite3`.

2. **Delete the Database File**: Simply delete the file eap_backend/db.sqlite3.

3. **Recreate the Database**:

    - Ensure you've set up the backend environment following these instructions.
    - Run the commands:

        ```bash
        $ python manage.py makemigrations
        $ python manage.py migrate
        ```

        This will establish a fresh sqlite file with an empty database.

## For Azure Deployments

1. **Allow IP Connection**:

    - If you haven't permitted your IP address to connect to the Azure database server, head to the Azure portal.
    - Find your database resource, and under "Connection security" in the left sidebar, select "Add current client IP address". Save your changes.

2. **Install `psql`**:
    - For Mac users with Homebrew: brew install postgresql.
    - For other OS users, consider searching for appropriate installation methods.

3. **Reset the Database via `psql`**:
    - Run the commands:

        ```bash
        psql --host=SERVER_NAME.postgres.database.azure.com --port=5432 --username=ADMIN_USERNAME@SERVER_NAME --dbname=postgres
        postgres=> DROP DATABASE eap;
        postgres=> CREATE DATABASE eap;
        postgres=> \c eap;
        postgres=> \q
        ```

        Replace `SERVER_NAME` and `ADMIN_USERNAME` with the appropriate values from the Azure portal. The admin password might be located in a keyvault.

4. **Restart the Backend Web App**:

    - In the Azure portal, locate the backend web app.
    - Restart it, and after a short wait, your application should be operational with a refreshed database.
