# Understanding the Assurance Ecosystem

In 2021, the UK Government's Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation released
their
[AI Assurance Roadmap](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-roadmap-to-an-effective-ai-assurance-ecosystem).
This publication set an agenda and series of recommendations for how to build an
effective AI Assurance ecosystem, including specifying key roles and
responsibilities. The following diagram shows a key set of actors, identified in
this report:

![This diagram depicts the AI assurance ecosystem, illustrating interactions between AI supply chain participants, AI Assurance Service Providers, Independent Researchers, and Supporting Structures like regulators and standards bodies.](../assets/images/actors.png)

As the diagram depicts, certain actors have a direct influence into the
(simplified) supply chain for AI systems. For instance, organisations may have
dedicated teams internally who are responsible for quality assurance of products
or services (e.g. compliance with safety standards, adherence to data privacy
and protection legislation). However, there is a growing marketplace of
independent assurance providers who offer consultancy or services to other
companies or organisations.[^market]

[^market]:
    For example, [Credo AI](https://www.credo.ai/) offer a paid-for service that
    comprises an interactive dashboard and set of tools to help companies comply
    with existing and emerging policies and regulation. Whereas, other
    organisations, such as the
    [Ada Lovelace Institute](https://www.adalovelaceinstitute.org/project/algorithmic-impact-assessment-healthcare/)
    have developed open-source tools for teams to implement within their own
    projects.

This is a helpful starting point for gaining some purchase on the complex set of
interacting roles and responsibilities that collectively make up what is
admittedly a hard to delineate assurance ecosystem. Rather than trying to build
a map of this ecosystem, we can instead focus on some of the typical roles and
responsibilities that the different actors have.
