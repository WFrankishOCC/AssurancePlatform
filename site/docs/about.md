# About the Trustworthy and Ethical Assurance Platform

The Trustworthy and Ethical Assurance platform, or TEA Platform ðŸ«– for short, is
an open-source tool that has been designed and developed by researchers at the
Alan Turing Institute and University of York to support the process of
developing and communicating assurance cases.

The whole purpose of an assurance case is to provide confidence and demonstrate
to stakeholders that a system is acceptably safe or secure for its intended use.
As such, the structure of an assurance case is important, and it should be
developed in such a way that facilitates communication and review by
stakeholders or third parties. For instance, using clear and accessible
terminology to assist those who need to understand and evaluate the assurance
argument. To support this, assurance cases are often organized into a modular,
hierarchical structure (e.g. higher-level goal claims supported by lower-level
sub-claims), and standardised approaches, such as Goal Structuring Notation
(GSN), exist to allow complex arguments to be broken down and understood more
easily.

## Our Platform

The Trustworthy and Ethical Assurance Platform has been designed and developed
to support the process of developing assurance cases, making it easier for
stakeholders to meaningfully engage with the assurance process.

<!-- !!! info "Current Project"

    Historically, an assurance case is a formal method of documentation, commonly used in safety-critical systems, which presents an argument for how a system satisfies particular safety, security, or reliability requirements (i.e. a goal). Assurance cases have been widely used in industries like energy, aviation, automotive, and more recently, healthcare, where the failure of a system to operate as expected can lead to significant consequences, including loss of life.

In addition to the tool itselfâ€”which has separate documentation regarding
installation, deployment, use, and developmentâ€”the TEA platform also contains
additional resources and user guidance regarding the TEA methodology (e.g. how
to build an assurance case).
