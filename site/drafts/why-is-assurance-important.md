# Why is Assurance Important?

Data-driven technologies, such as artificial intelligence, have a complex
lifecycle. In some cases, this complexity is further heightened by the scale at
which a system is deployed (e.g. social media platforms with international
reach).

The scale and complexity of certain data-driven technologies has already been
clearly communicated by others, such as
[this excellent infographic](https://anatomyof.ai) from the AI Now Institute
showing the many societal impacts and touch points that occur in the development
of Amazon’s smart speaker. Therefore, it is not necessary to revisit this point
here. However, it is important to explain why this complexity and scale matters
for the purpose of trustworthy and ethical assurance. There are three
(well-rehearsed) reasons that are salient within the context of the assurance
ecosystem:

1. Complexity: as the complexity of a system increases it becomes harder to
   maintain transparency and explainability.
2. Scalability: the risk of harm increases proportional to the scale of a
   system, and mechanisms for holding people or organisations accountable become
   harder to implement.
3. Autonomous behaviour: where data-driven technologies are used to enable
   autonomous behaviour, opportunities for responsible human oversight are
   reduced.
