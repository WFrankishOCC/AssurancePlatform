# Code of Conduct

> This document is adapted from the Turing Way's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Our Pledge

We value the participation of every member of our community and want to ensure that every contributor has an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, everyone who contributes to this project or engages the community (e.g. through [discussions](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AssurancePlatform/discussions)) is expected to show respect and courtesy to other community members at all times.

We are dedicated to a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion.
**We do not tolerate harassment by and/or of members of our community in any form.**

Despite having limited resources and a small team, we are motivated to support new and/or anxious collaborators, people who are looking to learn and develop their skills, and anyone who has experienced discrimination in the past.

To make clear what is expected, we ask all members of the community to conform to the following Code of Conduct.

## Our Standards

### Expected Behaviour

- **Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences**. Do not engage in homophobic, racist, transphobic, ageist, ableist, sexist, or otherwise exclusionary behaviour.
- **Use welcoming and inclusive language**. Exclusionary comments or jokes, threats or violent language are not acceptable. Do not address others in an angry, intimidating, or demeaning manner. Be considerate of the ways the words you choose may impact others. Be patient and respectful of the fact that English is a second (or third or fourth!) language for some participants.
- **Respect the privacy and safety of others**. Do not take photographs of others without their permission. Do not share other participant’s personal experiences without their express permission. Note that posting (or threatening to post) personally identifying information of others without their consent ("doxing") is a form of harassment.
- **Be considerate of others’ participation**. Everyone should have an opportunity to be heard. In update sessions, please keep comments succinct so as to allow maximum engagement by all participants. Do not interrupt others on the basis of disagreement; hold such comments until they have finished speaking.
- **Don’t be a bystander**. If you see something inappropriate happening, speak up. If you don't feel comfortable intervening but feel someone should, please feel free to ask a member of the Code of Conduct response team for support.
- As an overriding general rule, please **be intentional in your actions and humble in your mistakes**.

### Unacceptable Behaviour

- Written or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people on the basis of membership of any specific group.
- Any form of harassment, which includes unwanted physical contact, sexual attention, or repeated social contact. Know that consent is explicit, conscious and continuous—not implied. If you are unsure whether your behaviour towards another person is welcome, ask them. If someone tells you to stop, do so.
- Causing someone to fear for their safety, such as through stalking, following, or intimidation.
- Violent threats or language directed against another person.
- The display of sexual or violent images.
- Unwelcome sexual attention.
- Non-consensual or unwelcome physical contact.
- Sustained disruption of talks, events or communications.
- Insults or put downs.
- Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or exclusionary jokes.
- Excessive swearing.
- Incitement to violence, suicide, or self-harm.
- Continuing to initiate interaction (including photography or recording) with someone after being asked to stop.
- Publication of private communication without consent.

### Consequences of Unacceptable Behaviour

Participants who are asked to stop any inappropriate behaviour are expected to comply immediately.
If a participant engages in behaviour that violates this Code of Conduct, they will be restricted from further participation or engagement with the platform and community.
