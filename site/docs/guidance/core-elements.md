# Core Elements of an Assurance Case

!!! info "Summary"

    In this section we will look at the core elements of an assurance case and how they relate to one another.

There are many ways to construct an assurance case and several standards exist to help users adopt shared practices.
For instance, the Goal Structuring Notation has thorough and comprehensive documentation for building assurance cases that align with their standards.

Trustworthy and Ethical Assurance diverges from other standards, primarily because it aims to simplify the process of developing and communicating assurance cases in order to open the process up to wider communities.
That is, we prioritise *accessibility* and *simplicity*.
The trade-off is that assurance cases developed using our platform are *less expressive* than others, but (hopefully) easier to understand.

All assurance cases contain the following core elements:

  B:::annotate --> C[(Evidence)];
