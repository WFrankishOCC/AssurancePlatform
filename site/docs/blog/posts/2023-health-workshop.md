# Health and AI

In November and December 2023, we will hold two workshops which will provide
focused, small group training to help health practitioners understand and
operationalise the ethical principles which apply to their Digital Healthcare
tool. They will then be introduced to the TEA methodology and platform, and be
supported in their use of the platform for their Digital Healthcare tool.
