# Why We Ask for Access to Your GitHub

We want to ensure transparency in how our platform works. So, why do we ask
you to log in via GitHub and grant us certain permissions? Let's break it down:

1. We value your hard work and creativity. **By accessing your GitHub email
   and username, we can associate every assurance case you create on our
   platform with you.** This ensures that you get the credit for your work and
   can easily manage and revisit your projects anytime.

2. We want to present users with the convenience of having their assurance
   cases sync automatically with their GitHub repositories. **By accessing
   selected repositories, we can save your creations right to your GitHub.**
   This means less manual work for you and an integrated backup of your
   projects.

3. We use GitHub authentication because it's a secure way to handle user
   logins. **Instead of building a separate login system, which can be prone
   to security vulnerabilities, using GitHub means we can rely on their
   trusted security measures.**

4. We only ask for what we need. **Access to your email and username is to
   ensure your projects are correctly associated with you. And repository
   access is solely for the TEA platform's synchronisation feature.** We won't
   peek into unrelated content or make unwanted changes.

Remember, our core mission is to help you build ethical and trustworthy
assurance cases. Your trust is paramount to us, and we're committed to
ensuring the safety and integrity of your data.
