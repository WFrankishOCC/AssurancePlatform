## About this Repository 🗂

This repository contains the code and documentation for the SAFE-D Assurance
platform—an application for building trustworthy and ethical assurance cases,
developed by researchers at the
[Alan Turing Institute](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwi-4ZW65bL-AhXJMMAKHfeGCJ8QFnoECBUQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.turing.ac.uk%2F&usg=AOvVaw0uxvZzQpCGw78bVsaCsSOm).

## What is SAFE-D Assurance? 🤝

> SAFE-D assurance is a methodology and procedure for developing a structured
> argument, which provides reviewable (and contestable) assurance that a set of
> claims about a normative goal of a data-driven technology are warranted given
> the available evidence.

The following elements are central to this methodology and procedure:

- **The SAFE-D Principles**: a set of five operationalisable ethical
  principles—Sustainability, Accountability, Fairness, Explainability, Data
  Stewardship—that have been carefully designed and refined to address
  real-world challenges associated with the design, development, and deployment
  of data-driven technologies.
- **Assurance Cases**: the documented argument that communicates the basis for
  how and why a goal has been achieved.
- **Argument Patterns**: starting templates for building assurance cases. They
  identify the types of claims (or, the sets of reasons) that need to be
  established to justify the associated top-level normative goal.

The SAFE-D Assurance platform brings these elements together in a usable and
accessible manner, and helps project teams to provide trustworthy and
justifiable assurance about the processes they undertook when designing,
developing, and deploying their technology or system.

## Installation Instructions 💻

The SAFE-D Assurance application can be run locally or deployed on your own
server or a cloud-based service (e.g. Azure). To view the different installation
instructions, please visit our documentation site:
