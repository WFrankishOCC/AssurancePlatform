# Practitioners Workshop

We’re organising a full-day remote UX workshop on 8th November (UK timezone),
where up to 15 individuals who are knowledgeable and working within the AI
field (research/R&D or product) and interested in assuring that they adopt
ethical practices will come together. Together, we’ll explore the ethical
landscapes of AI, understanding its intricate challenges, and crafting pathways
towards responsible and innovative use.

## Structure

In part one, we're hoping to have an open discussion on the role that ethical
practices play within companies adopting AI, addressing challenges in adherence
and internal teams' considerations.

In part two, we will introduce the method of assurance based arguments to
support organisation of ethical claims and hope to understand if this
methodology may be useful to teams when considering ethical practices. Your
candid thoughts would be highly valuable as we progress with our research work.

An optional third part (on a separate day), a prototype session, aims to test
the current prototype to improve usability for future users. This session will
focus on an early software prototype that we have developed to assist companies
in organising and communicating their ethical practices. The session will take
one hour and will be led by a facilitator who will take you through scenarios
to test and will end with follow up questions on your thoughts.

## Dates

The workshop will take place on Wednesday 8th November 2023, 10:00–15:00.

There are follow-up prototyping sessions (1h long) in which participants can
optionally participate, on Wednesday 15th and Thursday 16th of November.
